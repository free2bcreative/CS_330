Scalars (primitives)
Aggregates (arrays, objects, etc)
  How do you access them?
    By name or position (arrays are accessed by position)
  Mixed?
    homogeneous
    heterogeneous (structs in Racket and C++)
    
; defining a type of struct in Racket
(define-struct student (name major gpa))

; contructor
(define bob 
  (make-student "Bob" "CS" 3.2))
  
(define alice 
  (make-student "Alice" "CS" 3.9))
  
; should return true
(student? bob)
